 ## Tuples
 Tuples are a type that can store multiple values into a group. You can also name each of the values if you choose to.
 */
// This is a tuple with a person's first name, last name and age.
var personTuple = ("Bob", "Smith", 23)

// We can access each value using their index
personTuple.0
personTuple.1
personTuple.2

// We can also consider naming each value for clarity
var namedPersonTuple = (firstName: "Jane", lastName: "Smith", age: 23)

// This way, we can also access the values using their name
namedPersonTuple.firstName
namedPersonTuple.lastName
namedPersonTuple.age

/*:
 - Experiment:
 Try creating your own tuple. Mix in different variable types and try mixing some parameters with names and some without. Does it still work?
 */

 - Experiment:
 Try nesting tuples within one another. Create a tuple and add a tuple as one of its items.

 We took a look at tuple earlier during the 'Loops' section. Can you tell where it is being used? Experiment with the tuple names and even change up the interesting numbers to see what's possible.

 Create a function that takes three parameters, a name of type `String`, an age of type `Int`, and eligable of type `Bool`. The function returns a tuple of the name and age if eligable is true, otherwise, it will return `nil`.

 ## Enums
 Enums are related values defined by the user. An example to think of this are the months within a year. There are only 12 months and when you are programming, you'll need a way to represent this. We could potentially use a String for each month, but that could lead to spelling mistakes. So instead, we can define our own values that makes it obvious to you.
 
 - Note:
 Enums in Swift are *WAY* more powerful than in Objective-C. Enums in Swift can have methods and an assigned value that can be a string, a character, or a value of any integer or floating-point type.
